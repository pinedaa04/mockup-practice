    <h2 class="about"> About Kittens To Go</h2>
    <p class="about-p"> Kittens To Go started all started with our CEO and Founder Jeremy. His favorite animal is a cat and wanted to share his love for cats with other people. During on his 30th birthday he wanted to throw himself a cat party. He wanted to bring as many cats as he could to his house so his family and friends could play with them. While investigating this information, he couldn't find any places that he could rent cats for his birthday. That is when he came up with the idea for Kittens To Go.</p>
    <p class="about-p"> Kittens To Go has been around for five years. We have partnered with many shelters to bring kittens to you! All of the cats that are up for rent are friendly and loveable. They also have up to date vaccinations as well as been spayed and neutured. </p>
